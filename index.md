# Collaborative distributed version control lesson

In this lesson we will learn how to keep repositories in sync and how to work
with remote repositories on GitHub and other services. We will discover and
exercise the fork-pull request (or merge request) workflow. We will discuss how
to organize branches to avoid conflicts and to simplify maintenance and release
preparation.  We will also exercise how to do some archaeology in the Git
history to find important commits for debugging and reproducibility.


## Prerequisites

1. Basic understanding of Git.

2. You need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
